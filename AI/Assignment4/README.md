Instruction for executing the code is contained in the homework description a4-online.pdf . 

The code for part 1 is solely handled by my project-mate. Part 2 is done solely by me. It has 3 algorithms for detecting image orientation:
- 1-Nearest Neighbor
- adaBoost
- neural networks with 1 hidden layer

The results of these algorithms are presented in Part_2_Report.pdf .

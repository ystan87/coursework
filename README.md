The contents listed in this repo is a showcase of coursework at Indiana University MS Data Science program.

Folder AI contains basically portions of code for *B551: Elements of AI* for which I have been the most significant contributor. The themes for Assignments 1,2,3 and 4 are respectively search, adversarial search, hidden Markov model and machine learning.

Folder migration contains my project for *Big Data Applications and Analytics*. There are instructions for running shell scripts to collect data, generate analysis and visualize. The OS configuration of Ubuntu 16.04 can support these scripts.

Folder network_science contains the deliverables of the final project, for replicating the results of the paper:

    *An Edge-Centric Perspective on the Human Connectome: Link Communities in the Brain,* 
         *by M. A. de Reus, V. M. Saenger, R. S. Kahn and M. P. van den Heuvel*. 

The folder includes a report and the code for generation of the analysis in IPython Notebook format.
